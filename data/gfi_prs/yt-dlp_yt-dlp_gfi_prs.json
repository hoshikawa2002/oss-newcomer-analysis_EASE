All of the information required for the episodes were in an `application/ld+json` tag in the webpage.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that there were several transformations on the thumbnail url in the JSON-LD in the that I have removed. I thought it would be best to remove all transformations and just return the original thumbnail. These transformations can result in returning smaller thumbnails for example:\r\n1. https://images.angelstudios.com/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_3840,q_auto/c_fill,q_auto,ar_16:9,g_north/v1643403801/angel-app/tuttle-twins/videos/season_1/Episode_1_App_Thumbnail.jpeg\r\n2. https://images.angelstudios.com/image/upload/b_rgb:000000,c_fill,h_630,w_1200,g_north/v1643403801/angel-app/tuttle-twins/videos/season_1/Episode_1_App_Thumbnail\r\n\r\nIndirectly fixes #1243. There are several links from https://watch.angelstudios.com that lead to https://www.angel.com where The Chosen series is also hosted, but supporting angel.com leads to support of more series.\r\n",

All of the information required for the episodes were in an `application/ld+json` tag in the webpage.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that there were several transformations on the thumbnail url in the JSON-LD in the that I have removed. I thought it would be best to remove all transformations and just return the original thumbnail. These transformations can result in returning smaller thumbnails for example:\r\n1. https://images.angelstudios.com/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_3840,q_auto/c_fill,q_auto,ar_16:9,g_north/v1643403801/angel-app/tuttle-twins/videos/season_1/Episode_1_App_Thumbnail.jpeg\r\n2. https://images.angelstudios.com/image/upload/b_rgb:000000,c_fill,h_630,w_1200,g_north/v1643403801/angel-app/tuttle-twins/videos/season_1/Episode_1_App_Thumbnail\r\n\r\nIndirectly fixes #1243. There are several links from https://watch.angelstudios.com that lead to https://www.angel.com where The Chosen series is also hosted, but supporting angel.com leads to support of more series.",
