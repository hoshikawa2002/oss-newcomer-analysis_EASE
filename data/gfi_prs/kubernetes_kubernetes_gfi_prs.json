      "body": "#### What type of PR is this?\r\n/kind cleanup\r\n/kind flake\r\n\r\n#### What this PR does / why we need it:\r\n\r\nThis cleans up the the test helper function `WaitForPodsRunningReady`. In particular, concretely defines the expected behavior for this function, rewrite to follow this expected behavior, and remove the log message that caused the original confusion.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #111092\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely simple issue that's remained open for a quite a while. With this being my first K8s PR, the simplicity was appealing to me! PRs have been opened to address this issue, but closed because agreement wasn't reached on how exactly to approach it. Of course, to agree on what to log, there needs to be clarity on what this function is doing. Unfortunately, I don't think the contract for this function has ever been well-defined.\r\n\r\nFirstly, what exactly does it mean to have one parameter specify the minimum of Ready Pods, another specify the maximum number of Pods that are allowed to not be Ready, but also document that this function waits for all Pods are either Ready or Failed? I have no idea how that's supposed to work before reading the code! However, reading the code doesn't clarify much.\r\n\r\nThe clearest way to see the problem with the previous code is to consider: \"What happens if every Pod in this Namespace fails?\" The code will remain polling for the duration of timeout. Once it exits, then `notReady` will be 0, and this function will return without an error! *Surely* this can't be the intended behavior. This code has been refactored over the past few years, but this same problem has existed since this file was created 5 years ago. This is just one example of why this code is problematic- simply incrementing `notReady` for failed Pods wouldn't completely fix things in my mind.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I needed to decide what the contract for this function should be. I chose one that balanced similarity to previous behavior with what I felt is expected behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWaitForPodsRunningReady waits up to timeout for the following conditions:\r\n 1. At least minPods Pods in Namespace ns are Running and Ready\r\n 2. No more than allowedNotReadyPods Pods in Namespace ns are not either\r\n    Ready, Succeeded, or Failed with a Controller.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I established this, it became clear that a bunch of the logic was entirely unecessary. In fact, I felt like that specific log line from the original Issue lost its purpose now that the presence of non-Ready Pods isn't treated as exceptional behavior, and I just removed it.\r\n\r\nOne notable consequence of establishing this contract is that this function now exits earlier than it used to in certain situations (roughly speaking, previously a single non-Ready Pod in the Namespace would make the function continue polling until `timeout`). Considering how amgiguous the contract for this function was previously, there's certainly risk that some tests in some environments implicitely rely upon this function taking longer than it needs to. All pertitent Linux e2e tests seem to be passing when run against a local WSL cluster, and I suppose we'll see about the CI tests. I assume that this sort of risk is considered acceptable?\r\n\r\n#### Update 4/14\r\n\r\nBased upon feedback, I split `WaitForPodsRunningReady` into two functions:\r\n\r\n1. `WaitForPodsRunningReady` is now substantially simplied. In addition to the above simplifications, I removed `allowedNotReadyPods` entirely, since it was unused by almost all of the callers.\r\n2. A new function, `WaitForAlmostAllPodsReady`, which is equivalent in behavior to the previous `WaitForPodsRunningReady`. I just kept some light cleanup I did.\r\n\r\nNotably, I opted to copy-and-paste code between the functions instead of trying to make it DRY. Since we're scared to touch `WaitForAlmostAllPodsReady` but have more confidence in what the semantics of `WaitForPodsRunningReady` are, it seems best to not couple these two functions at all.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below. If the PR requires additional action from users switching to the new release, include the string \"action required\".\r\n\r\nFor more information on release notes see: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/release-notes.md\r\n-->\r\n```release-note\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\nN/A\r\n",

In particular, concretely defines the expected behavior for this function, rewrite to follow this expected behavior, and remove the log message that caused the original confusion.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\r\nFixes #111092\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely simple issue that's remained open for a quite a while. With this being my first K8s PR, the simplicity was appealing to me! PRs have been opened to address this issue, but closed because agreement wasn't reached on how exactly to approach it. Of course, to agree on what to log, there needs to be clarity on what this function is doing. Unfortunately, I don't think the contract for this function has ever been well-defined.\r\n\r\nFirstly, what exactly does it mean to have one parameter specify the minimum of Ready Pods, another specify the maximum number of Pods that are allowed to not be Ready, but also document that this function waits for all Pods are either Ready or Failed? I have no idea how that's supposed to work before reading the code! However, reading the code doesn't clarify much.\r\n\r\nThe clearest way to see the problem with the previous code is to consider: \"What happens if every Pod in this Namespace fails?\" The code will remain polling for the duration of timeout. Once it exits, then `notReady` will be 0, and this function will return without an error! *Surely* this can't be the intended behavior. This code has been refactored over the past few years, but this same problem has existed since this file was created 5 years ago. This is just one example of why this code is problematic- simply incrementing `notReady` for failed Pods wouldn't completely fix things in my mind.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I needed to decide what the contract for this function should be. I chose one that balanced similarity to previous behavior with what I felt is expected behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWaitForPodsRunningReady waits up to timeout for the following conditions:\r\n 1. At least minPods Pods in Namespace ns are Running and Ready\r\n 2. No more than allowedNotReadyPods Pods in Namespace ns are not either\r\n    Ready, Succeeded, or Failed with a Controller.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I established this, it became clear that a bunch of the logic was entirely unecessary. In fact, I felt like that specific log line from the original Issue lost its purpose now that the presence of non-Ready Pods isn't treated as exceptional behavior, and I just removed it.\r\n\r\nOne notable consequence of establishing this contract is that this function now exits earlier than it used to in certain situations (roughly speaking, previously a single non-Ready Pod in the Namespace would make the function continue polling until `timeout`). Considering how amgiguous the contract for this function was previously, there's certainly risk that some tests in some environments implicitely rely upon this function taking longer than it needs to. All pertitent Linux e2e tests seem to be passing when run against a local WSL cluster, and I suppose we'll see about the CI tests. I assume that this sort of risk is considered acceptable?\r\n\r\n#### Update 4/14\r\n\r\nBased upon feedback, I split `WaitForPodsRunningReady` into two functions:\r\n\r\n1. `WaitForPodsRunningReady` is now substantially simplied. In addition to the above simplifications, I removed `allowedNotReadyPods` entirely, since it was unused by almost all of the callers.\r\n2. A new function, `WaitForAlmostAllPodsReady`, which is equivalent in behavior to the previous `WaitForPodsRunningReady`. I just kept some light cleanup I did.\r\n\r\nNotably, I opted to copy-and-paste code between the functions instead of trying to make it DRY. Since we're scared to touch `WaitForAlmostAllPodsReady` but have more confidence in what the semantics of `WaitForPodsRunningReady` are, it seems best to not couple these two functions at all.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\nN/A",

The existing documentation suggested that negative values would defer to the pod's specified grace period, but in practice, this is not the case.\r\n\r\n## Changes made\r\n- Updated the parameter description to accurately describe the current behavior\r\n- Added a note clarifying that negative values result in immediate termination\r\n- Maintained the original description of the primary functionality\r\n\r\n## Special notes for reviewers\r\nThe change is focused on aligning documentation with actual implementation behavior, as discussed in the original issue.\r\n\r\nFixes #118172",

The existing documentation suggested that negative values would defer to the pod's specified grace period, but in practice, this is not the case.\r\n\r\n## Changes made\r\n- Updated the parameter description to accurately describe the current behavior\r\n- Added a note clarifying that negative values result in immediate termination\r\n- Maintained the original description of the primary functionality\r\n\r\n## Special notes for reviewers\r\nThe change is focused on aligning documentation with actual implementation behavior, as discussed in the original issue.\r\n\r\nFixes #118172",
