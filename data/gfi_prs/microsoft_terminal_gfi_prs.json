I am happy to change the implementation to better fit your (planned) architecture.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\r\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\r\n\r\nWhile researching the solution, I noticed that the XAML system was always opening the system menu after Alt+Space, even when explicitly setting the event to be handled according to the documentation. The only solution I could find was to hook into the \"XAML bypass\" already in place for F7 KeyDown, and Alt KeyUp keystrokes. This bypass sends the keystroke to the AppHost immediately. This bypass method will \"fall back\" to the normal XAML routing when the keystroke is not handled.\r\n\r\nThe implemented behaviour is as follows:\r\n- Default: same as normal; system menu is working since the bypass does not handle the keystroke\r\n- Alt+Space explicitly unbound: bypass passes the keystroke to the terminal and marks it as handled\r\n- Alt+Space bound to command: bypass invokes the command and marks it as handled\r\n\r\nConcretely, added a method to the KeyBindings and ActionMap interfaces to check whether a keychord is explicitly unbound. The implementation for `_GetActionByKeyChordInternal` already distinguishes between explicitly unbound and lack of binding, however this distinction is not carried over to the public methods. I decided not to change this existing method, to avoid breaking other stuff and to make the API more explicit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there were some checks against Alt+Space further down in the code, preventing this keystroke from being entered in the terminal. Since the check for this keystroke is now done at a \"higher\" level, I thought I could safely remove these checks as otherwise the keystroke could never be sent to the terminal itself. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nNote that when alt+space is bound to an action that opens the command pallette (such as tab search), then a second press of the key combination does still open the system menu. This is because at that point, the \"bypass\" is cancelled (called \"not a good implementation\" in #4031). I don't think this can easily be solved for now, but this is a very minor bug/inconvenience.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\nAdded tests for the new method. Performed manual checking:\r\n* [x] Default configuration still opens system menu like normal\r\n* [x] Binding alt+space to an action performs the action and does not show the system menu\r\n* [x] Explicitly unbinding alt+space no longer shows the system menu and sends the keystroke to the terminal. I was unable to run the debug tap (it crashed my instance - same thing happening on preview and release builds) to check for sure, but behaviour was identical to native linux terminals.",

This complements the existing useMica setting, providing more flexibility in applying Windows 11 visual styles.\r\n\r\n## References and Relevant Issues\r\nCloses #17650\r\nInternal discussion: [Enable support for Mica Alt in terminal settings appearance]\r\n\r\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\r\n\t•\tAdded a new boolean property useMicaAlt in profiles.schema.json to allow users to opt into the Mica Alt effect.\r\n\t•\tIntroduced _useMicaAlt variable and UseMicaAlt() getter in GlobalAppSettings.cpp/h.\r\n\t•\tParsed the setting in LayerJson() to bind it to the global config model.\r\n\t•\tExtended the conditional logic in MainPage.cpp to apply the Mica Alt background when enabled.\r\n\t•\tThis implementation mirrors the useMica structure for consistency and ease of maintenance.\r\n\r\nNo separate visual style was introduced at this stage — MicaAlt reuses the existing Mica logic as a starting point for future differentiation if needed.\r\n\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\n\t•\tManually enabled \"useMicaAlt\": true in settings.json\r\n\t•\tVerified background behavior in the settings page correctly triggers SettingsPageMicaBackground\r\n\t•\tConfirmed fallback to standard background when useMicaAlt is false\r\n\t•\tRegression-checked useMica to ensure no interference\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\t•\tCloses #17650\r\n\t•\tTests added/passed (optional — maintainers may handle this)\r\n\t•\tDocumentation updated\r\n\t•\tSchema updated in profiles.schema.json\r\n\t•\tDocumentation PR: (If needed, can be filed here → https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/terminal)\r\n\r\n@microsoft-github-policy-service agree",
