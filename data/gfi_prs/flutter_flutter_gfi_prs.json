The `_placeChildren` method in the render object has been updated to arrange items from right-to-left when in an RTL context.",

        "Refactor: Improve layout logic in Material text selection toolbar\n\nThis commit refactors the `_placeChildrenVertically` method within the `_TextSelectionToolbarContentLayout` class of the Material text selection toolbar.\n\nThe changes include:\n- Using `visitChildren` for iterating over child render objects, replacing the manual linked-list traversal.\n- Renaming `maxItemWidth` to `maxWidth` for clarity.\n- Removing the unused `nextSize` variable.\n- Simplifying the logic for handling the navigation button.\n\nThese changes improve the readability and maintainability of the vertical layout logic for the overflow menu in the Material text selection toolbar.",
        "Refactor: Simplify logic in `TextSelectionToolbar`\n\nThis commit refactors the logic within the `TextSelectionToolbar`'s `performLayout` method.\nSpecifically, it streamlines the condition for determining whether a child should be painted. Instead of checking `_shouldPaintChild` and then setting `shouldPaint` to true or false, it now directly checks `!_shouldPaintChild` to set `shouldPaint` to false, with an `else` block to set it to true. This improves readability without changing the underlying behavior.",
